<h2>Help</h2>

<p>In order to set up all to have everything up and running in a test environment, this is the checklist to follow. 
The deployment in production is out of scope of the following instructions.</p>

<li>1. Install <a href="https://docs.getgophish.com/user-guide/installation">Gophish</a> as per instructions in the website.</li>
<br>
<li>2. Set up the config.json file for Gophish as per your needs checking the information in the link above. Example of 
file in folder docs in the project_root package.</li>
<br>
<li>3. Once Gophish is up and running, open the URL in your browser and change the API key 
as indicated <a href="https://docs.getgophish.com/user-guide/documentation/changing-user-settings">here</a>.
You will not need to get access to GoPhish directly anymore, but copy the key since you will use it for VeraPhish configuration.</li>
<br>
<li>4. Install <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">python</a> in case you do not have it yet.</li>
<br>
<li>5. Install the GoPhish API for python as per instructions in <a href="https://docs.getgophish.com/python-api-client/">here</a>.</li>
<br>
<li>6. Install the <a href="https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/topics/install/">Django framework</a>.</li>
<br>
<li>7. Place VeraPhish files package in a place reachable for your Python and Django installation.</li>
<br>
<li>9. Configure cfg files for both apps (phishing and surveys), in the /modules/config/ folder 
(SETAphish.cfg and SETAsurvey.csg respectively). There are examples for everything 
in /docs within the project_root package, and you will have to use the Gophish API 
key you wrote down in #3 so that all match.</li>
<br>
<li>10. All views in the app are only for admins (login required), except: main page 
which is dynamic, static views (help, about, license, contact), and the make survey link 
(so that users can be trained without logging in). Hence, you will need to create 
a superuser before starting to use the app (executing "python manage.py createsuperuser")
in the main directory of the app. Alternatively, you could uncomment the Register link in 
the login view, but it is not very recommendable since anyone could create their own users 
while answering surveys.</li>
<br>
<li>11. Execute python manage.py runserver from a terminal in the main app directory, and you
 are good to go with some testing (this tutorial is not intended to show how to set up a 
production environment/server. You will have to take care of SSL certificates, 
spam filtering when sending phishing emails..., etc).</li>
<br>
<li>12. Logical testing steps would be: within the Pishing section of the web app, create at least 
an user group, an email template page, a landing page, an SMTP profile and a phishing campaign. 
Later you can go to the Survey section and create a survey template, and a training survey 
based on the phishing campaign created earlier, or on the target group itself (first option will 
leverage on phishing results to build the A-score indicator, which will not be available otherwise). 
Example files where needed are in folder /docs within the project_root package, but I think using 
the webapp is quite self-explanatory.</li>
<br>

<li>13. Database handling: all Gophish objects (user groups, email and landing page templates, 
SMTP profiles and phishing campaigns), are stored within Gophish database, whereas Survey templates, 
Trainings launched and related User answer objects are within Django database. Even though 
all actions can be performed from the app itself, django database objects can be manipulated 
directly from the admin panel, which can be useful for testing 
(e.g. in "http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/" if you ran the server with "python manage.py runserver").</li>
<br>

<p>That should be all. <a href="{% url 'show_contact' %}">Let me know</a> if anything is unclear or I am missing 
something. Perhaps is worth mentioning I made all the development and testing in a 
windows 10 workstation.</p>
